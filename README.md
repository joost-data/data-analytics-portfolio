# Data Analytics Portfolio


## About this portfolio


I am a **Data Analyst and Marketing Analyst with 12+ years of experience** turning complex marketing and product data into dashboards, experiments, and **executive-ready insights**.


Across SaaS and research organizations in **7 countries on 3 continents**, I’ve built and maintained analytics and reporting using **Google Analytics, Matomo, Looker Studio, and Power BI**, supporting decision-making for marketing, sales, and leadership teams.


My work sits at the intersection of **data and decision-makers**. I focus on:
- Defining the *right business questions*
- Gathering, cleaning, and modeling data (**SQL, Python, Excel**)
- Translating analysis into **clear stories, recommendations, and actions**


In recent roles, I’ve been responsible for **diagnosing marketing performance and strategy**, conducting deep-dive analysis, shaping experimentation, and delivering **dashboarding and reporting for leadership** rather than hands-on campaign execution.


This portfolio showcases how I:
- Approach real-world analytics problems
- Structure reproducible analysis
- Communicate insights clearly for non-technical stakeholders


I am currently formalizing my analytics stack through the **IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate (Coursera)** and **boot.dev (Python, Git, SQL)**, while deepening my use of **generative AI for data analysis and storytelling** (ChatGPT/OpenAI, prompt design, AI-assisted visualization).


From **early 2026**, I am targeting **Data Analyst / Marketing Analyst roles** where I can combine hands-on analysis, AI-assisted workflows, and strong stakeholder communication.

# Data Analytics Portfolio

## About

I’m Joost — a data and marketing analyst with 12+ years of experience turning marketing and product data into dashboards, experiments, and exec-ready insights.

I’ve built reporting in SaaS and research environments using Google Analytics/Matomo, Looker Studio, and Power BI, in data-enabled roles across 7 countries on 3 continents.

I bridge data and decision-makers: defining the right questions, gathering and cleaning data (SQL, Python, Excel), and translating analysis into clear recommendations for marketing, sales, and leadership. Recent work has focused on performance diagnosis, deep-dive analysis, experimentation support, and leadership reporting (rather than hands-on campaign execution).

As of Nov 2025, I’m formalizing my analytics stack through the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate and boot.dev (Python, Git, SQL). I also use generative AI selectively to accelerate analysis and communication (prompting, drafting, and visual iteration), with an emphasis on verification and reproducibility.

## Projects

### Project 01 — Superstore SQL Case Study (SQLite)
End-to-end SQL case study using a retail dataset.

**What I did**
- Normalized raw CSV data into a relational schema (`customers`, `products`, `orders`, `order_items`).
- Built an enriched analysis view (date parsing + shipping-days calculation) to support time-series and operational analysis.
- Quantified profit drivers and loss concentration to support pricing/discount decisions.

**Evidence (selected)**
- Overall profit margin: **12.47%** (profit **$286,397** on sales **$2,297,201**).
- Discount depth is the dominant profitability driver:
  - **0% discount:** **29.51%** margin (**+$320,988** profit)
  - **30%+ discount:** **-48.16%** margin (**-$125,007** profit)
- Losses concentrate in a small set of sub-categories and SKUs (notably **Tables** and several **Machines** products).
